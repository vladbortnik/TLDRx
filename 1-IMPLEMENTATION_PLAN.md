2. **Phase 2** adds core functionality (platforms + content sections)
3. **Phase 3** enhances UX (interactivity + organization)
4. **Phase 4** completes with polish (remaining features + design)

---

## 🖥️ Platform Filter Feature Details

### Implementation Approach:

- **Location**: Near the search field (alongside the TL;DR logo)
- **UI Design**: Dropdown button or toggle chips showing available platforms
- **Behavior**: Filter commands in real-time based on platform compatibility
- **Default State**: Show all commands (no platform filter applied)
- **Smart Detection**: Optionally auto-detect user's OS and suggest appropriate platform

### Platform Options:

- **Linux** (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.) - shows `apt`, `yum`, `systemctl`
- **macOS** - shows `brew`, `launchctl`, excludes Linux-only commands
- **Windows** - shows PowerShell commands, WSL-compatible commands
- **BSD** (FreeBSD, OpenBSD) - shows BSD-specific variants
- **All Platforms** - shows universal commands like `git`, `curl`, `ssh`

### User Experience:

1. User sees platform filter button/dropdown near search field
2. Clicking reveals platform options with clear icons/labels
3. Selecting a platform immediately filters the command list
4. Search functionality works within the filtered results
5. Clear visual indicator shows active platform filter
6. Easy way to clear/reset filter to show all commands

### Technical Implementation:

- Add `selectedPlatform` state to App component
- Filter `displayCommands` based on command's `platforms` array
- Update search logic to work within filtered subset
- Add platform filter component with clear visual design

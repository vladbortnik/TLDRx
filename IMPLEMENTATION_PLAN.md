## üöÄ Implementation Order

Each phase builds logically on the previous one:

2. **Phase 2** adds core functionality (platforms + content sections)
3. **Phase 3** enhances UX (interactivity + organization)
4. **Phase 4** completes with polish (remaining features + design)

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Platform Filter Feature Details

### Implementation Approach:

- **Location**: Near the search field (alongside the TL;DR logo)
- **UI Design**: Dropdown button or toggle chips showing available platforms
- **Behavior**: Filter commands in real-time based on platform compatibility
- **Default State**: Show all commands (no platform filter applied)
- **Smart Detection**: Optionally auto-detect user's OS and suggest appropriate platform

### Platform Options:

- **Linux** (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.) - shows `apt`, `yum`, `systemctl`
- **macOS** - shows `brew`, `launchctl`, excludes Linux-only commands
- **Windows** - shows PowerShell commands, WSL-compatible commands
- **BSD** (FreeBSD, OpenBSD) - shows BSD-specific variants
- **All Platforms** - shows universal commands like `git`, `curl`, `ssh`

### User Experience:

1. User sees platform filter button/dropdown near search field
2. Clicking reveals platform options with clear icons/labels
3. Selecting a platform immediately filters the command list
4. Search functionality works within the filtered results
5. Clear visual indicator shows active platform filter
6. Easy way to clear/reset filter to show all commands

### Technical Implementation:

- Add `selectedPlatform` state to App component
- Filter `displayCommands` based on command's `platforms` array
- Update search logic to work within filtered subset
- Add platform filter component with clear visual design

## üìä Expected Data Structure Changes

### Current Command Object:

  standsFor: "advanced package tool", // optional
  platform: ["linux"], // existing
  category: "package-management", // existing
  examples: [
    "apt update # Update package lists",
    "apt upgrade # Upgrade installed packages"
  ]
}
```

### Enhanced Command Object:

```javascript
{
  name: "apt",
  description: "Package management utility for Debian-based distributions",
  standsFor: "advanced package tool",
  platforms: ["linux"], // standardized name
  category: "package-management",
  safety: "caution", // "safe" | "caution" | "destructive"
  prerequisites: ["sudo access"], // array of requirements
  commonFlags: [ // new field
    { flag: "-y", description: "Assume yes to prompts" },
    { flag: "--dry-run", description: "Simulate actions without executing" }
  ],
  syntaxPattern: "apt [options] <command> [package-name]", // new field
  relatedCommands: ["dpkg", "aptitude", "snap"], // new field
  troubleshooting: "Run 'apt update' first if you get package not found errors", // new field
  examples: [
    "apt update # Update package lists",
    "apt upgrade # Upgrade installed packages",
    "apt install package # Install package",
